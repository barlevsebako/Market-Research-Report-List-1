<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dorsal Column Stimulator (DCS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dorsal Column Stimulator (DCS) market is divided into two primary segments: implantable and non-implantable devices. Implantable DCS systems are surgically placed within the body to deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord, providing relief from chronic pain and improving quality of life. Non-implantable DCS devices, on the other hand, are external systems that can be used for pain management without surgical procedures. Both types cater to different patient needs, preferences, and medical conditions.</p></p>
